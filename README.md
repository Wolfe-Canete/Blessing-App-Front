## Welcome
Welcome to **The Bite-Sized Book Of Itty Bitty Blessings (BoB)**. This we app is your personal place to discover and share itty bitty blessings that make the day a little bit better! The concept of this app was founded on a principle in mental health awareness known as [mindfulness](https://www.mindful.org/what-is-mindfulness/), a commonly practiced exercise in grounding one's self in both serenity and strife. Everyday people from all walks of life (strugglers, survivors, or people in pursuit of peace) practice mindfulness in all sorts of ways, but the most familiar approach is to recognize the blessings one has experienced, big and small. Through this app, you will be able to share your blessing(s) and what it means to you. Others will be able to view and share as well! **(BoB)** was developed by **Tyler Wolfe** and **Joachim Canete**.
